# OpenGL Soft Body Dynamics

## Overview
This project implements real-time soft body dynamics using OpenGL and physics-based simulation techniques. It models elastic and deformable objects interacting with forces like gravity and collisions.

## Features
- Soft body physics simulation using mass-spring models
- Real-time rendering with OpenGL
- Adjustable stiffness, damping, and elasticity parameters
- User interaction for applying forces

### U need that bro
- C++ compiler (GCC/Clang/MSVC)
- OpenGL
- GLFW
- GLAD
- glm (OpenGL Mathematics Library)

## Usage
- Use `WASD` keys to move the camera.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit issues or pull requests.

## Acknowledgments
- OpenGL Community
- GLFW and GLAD for window and OpenGL context handling
- glm for mathematics computations
